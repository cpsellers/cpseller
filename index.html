  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h2>1. Is this real?</h2>
  <p>Yes, it’s 100% real. You’ll get full access to a massive collection of 10,000+ HD videos and 30,000+ images once your payment is processed. Everything works as described, no hidden tricks.</p>

  <h2>2. How do I get access?</h2>
  <p>After payment, you’ll receive a private, encrypted link directly to your email. The link takes you to the full collection without requiring registration or login.</p>

  <h2>3. What payment methods are accepted?</h2>
  <p>I accept only cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, and USDT. Crypto provides the highest level of privacy and security for both parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Is this a subscription?</h2>
  <p>No. This is a one-time payment that gives you lifetime access to the content. There are no hidden charges, no subscriptions, no recurring fees.</p>

  <h2>5. Is the content organized?</h2>
  <p>Yes. The content is neatly organized by category, genre, and type. You can easily navigate through videos and images without any hassle.</p>

  <h2>6. Can I download or stream the content?</h2>
  <p>You can do both. Stream content directly from the private site or download any file to your device for offline access.</p>

  <h2>7. What if the site goes down?</h2>
  <p>If the private link ever goes down, just contact me. I have multiple backup mirrors ready to ensure uninterrupted access. You'll never lose your content.</p>

  <h2>8. Can I access the site on mobile?</h2>
  <p>Yes, the private site is fully mobile-optimized. You can access everything on Android, iOS, or any tablet without issues.</p>

  <h2>9. Do you offer previews or samples?</h2>
  <p>No previews or samples are offered. I believe in a straight-up, no-nonsense approach. You get what you pay for, and it’s all listed upfront.</p>

  <h2>10. Is my privacy protected?</h2>
  <p>Yes. I don’t collect any personal data. There are no logs, no tracking scripts, and no cookies. You access the content privately, with complete anonymity.</p>

  <h2>11. Can I use my real email?</h2>
  <p>You can, but I suggest using a burner email for complete privacy. Services like ProtonMail or Tutanota are great for keeping your details private.</p>

  <h2>12. How long will it take to get access after payment?</h2>
  <p>Typically, you’ll get access within 10-15 minutes after payment. If I’m offline, you’ll get it as soon as I check. I don’t leave people waiting.</p>

  <h2>13. What if I make a mistake with the payment?</h2>
  <p>If you send the wrong amount, reach out with your payment proof. I’ll help you sort it out and ensure you get the access you paid for.</p>

  <h2>14. Can I request a refund?</h2>
  <p>No, there are no refunds. Once access is granted, the deal is final. I make everything clear before you purchase to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>

  <h2>15. Is the content high quality?</h2>
  <p>Yes. All videos are in HD or higher, and images are high resolution. You’ll get the best quality available, with no low-res or stretched content.</p>

  <h2>16. Do you offer custom content requests?</h2>
  <p>I don’t take custom requests at the moment, but I do regularly update the collection based on popular demand.</p>

  <h2>17. Is the site safe to use?</h2>
  <p>Yes. The site is hosted securely with encryption. I don’t track or store any data, so your activity is kept private. You’re completely safe while browsing.</p>

  <h2>18. Can I use a VPN to access the site?</h2>
  <p>Yes, and I highly recommend using a VPN if you want extra privacy. It’s always a good idea to add another layer of security.</p>

  <h2>19. Will I be contacted after purchasing?</h2>
  <p>No. Once you’ve received your access, I won’t contact you unless you reach out for support or assistance. I don’t spam or follow up.</p>

  <h2>20. Can I share the link with others?</h2>
  <p>No. The link is private and for your use only. Sharing it will result in revoked access, and no refunds will be given.</p>

  <h2>21. How can I be sure this is not a scam?</h2>
  <p>I don’t make false promises. If I say something is included, it’s included. I deliver what I promise — no fake reviews, no exaggerated claims.</p>

  <h2>22. What if I lose my private link?</h2>
  <p>If you lose the link, just contact me with your transaction ID, and I’ll resend it to you. You won’t have to pay again for lost access.</p>

  <h2>23. Is the site password protected?</h2>
  <p>No, the private link itself is the key. There’s no need for additional passwords. Just open the link and access everything directly.</p>

  <h2>24. Can I watch content offline?</h2>
  <p>Yes. You can download any content and watch it offline whenever you want. It’s all available for permanent access.</p>

  <h2>25. Is this content safe from viruses?</h2>
  <p>Yes. All files are scanned for malware and viruses before they’re uploaded. Everything is clean and safe to download or stream.</p>

  <h2>27. Is the site compatible with all browsers?</h2>
  <p>Yes. The site is fully compatible with all modern browsers — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. You won’t face compatibility issues.</p>

  <h2>28. Can I use the content commercially?</h2>
  <p>No. The content is for personal use only. Reselling or distributing it publicly is strictly prohibited and will result in permanent ban.</p>

  <p>No. The price listed is the final price. There are no hidden fees, charges, or surprise costs.</p>

  <p>No. All transactions are anonymous. You only need to send cryptocurrency, and I’ll handle the rest.</p>

  <h2>38. Will the content ever expire?</h2>
